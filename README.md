# minizip 2.6.0

minizip is a zip manipulation library written in C that is supported on Windows, macOS, and Linux. 

[![License: Zlib](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-zlib-lightgrey.svg)](https://github.com/nmoinvaz/minizip/blob/master/LICENSE)

Maintained by Nathan Moinvaziri.

## Fork Motivation and History

This library is a complete refactoring of the minizip contribution found in the zlib
distribution. The motivation for this fork has been the inclusion of advanced features, 
improvements in code maintainability and readability, and the reduction of duplicate code.

Minizip was originally developed by [Gilles Vollant](http://www.winimage.com/zLibDll/minizip.html) and 
had been contributed to by many people. As part of the zlib distribution, Mark Adler has maintained the
original [minizip](https://github.com/madler/zlib/tree/master/contrib/minizip) project.

In 2006, I began working with the minizip project and started submitting bugs I found in the library to 
Gilles Vollant via e-mail. In 2010, I implemented some additional features like disk splitting, 
I/O buffering, and AES encryption. My continued work on the project necessitated setting up a public 
repository so I could share these and other improvements with the rest of the world. I have been maintaining 
and actively developing this fork of the project ever since. In 2017, I refactored and rewrote most of 
library as it had become difficult to maintain and code readability had suffered over the years.

## Build

To generate project files for your platform:

1. [Download and install](https://cmake.org/install/) cmake.
2. [Download](https://zlib.net/) and install zlib if it is not installed on your system.
3. Run cmake in the minizip directory.

```
cmake . -DBUILD_TEST=ON
cmake --build .
```

## Build Options

| Name | Description | Default Value |
|:- |:-|:-:|
| USE_ZLIB | Enables ZLIB compression | ON |
| USE_BZIP2 | Enables BZIP2 compression | ON |
| USE_LZMA | Enables LZMA compression | ON |
| USE_PKCRYPT | Enables PKWARE traditional encryption | ON |
| USE_AES | Enables WinZIP AES encryption | ON |
| USE_LIBCOMP | Enables Apple compression | OFF |
| COMPRESS_ONLY | Only support compression | OFF |
| DECOMPRESS_ONLY | Only support decompression | OFF |
| BUILD_TEST | Builds minizip test executable | OFF |

## Zlib Installation (Windows)

Option 1. Install the zlib package to the Program Files directory with an Administrator command prompt.

```
cmake . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=%PROGRAMFILES%\zlib
cmake --build . --config Release --target INSTALL
```

Option 2. Compile zlib in minizip's lib directory. 

```
cmake .
cmake --build . --config Release
```

Navigate back to the minizip directory and before building run:

```
cmake . -DZLIB_LIBRARY=lib\zlib\release\zlibstatic.lib -DZLIB_INCLUDE_DIR=lib\zlib\
```

## Third-Party Libraries

+ [zlib](https://zlib.net/) written by Mark Adler and Jean-loup Gailly.
  + Not included in this repository
  + Or alternatively, [zlib-ng](https://github.com/Dead2/zlib-ng) by Hans Kristian Rosbach
+ [BZIP2](https://www.sourceware.org/bzip2/) written by Julian Seward.
+ [liblzma](https://tukaani.org/xz/) written by Lasse Collin.
  + Modifications were made to support the ZIP file format specification
+ [AES](https://github.com/BrianGladman/aes) and [SHA](https://github.com/BrianGladman/sha) libraries of Brian Gladman.

## Limitations

+ Archives are required to have a central directory.
+ Central directory header values should be correct and it is necessary for the compressed size to be accurate for AES encryption.
+ Central directory encryption is not supported due to licensing restrictions mentioned by PKWARE in their zip appnote.
+ Central directory is the only data stored on the last disk of a split-disk archive and doesn't follow disk size restrictions.

## Acknowledgments

Thanks to [Gilles Vollant](http://www.winimage.com/zLibDll/minizip.html) on which this work is originally based on. 

Thanks go out to all the people who have taken the time to contribute code reviews, testing and/or patches. This project would not have been nearly as good without you.

The [ZIP format](https://github.com/nmoinvaz/minizip/blob/master/doc/appnote.txt) was defined by Phil Katz of PKWARE.
